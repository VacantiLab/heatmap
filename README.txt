This repository contains a suite of functions for creating proteomics and transcriptomics data visualizations implementing customizable normalization and transformation strategies. The files are named after the visualizations they produce. For now, instructions for use are contained in the comments of the .R files (admittedly not the best practice but will be corrected as soon as the NIH comes through with funding to support production code in academic labs).
